Raspberry Pi-Arduino Laboratory (smart-device)
===============================================
In this repositroy you can find the basic files needeed to built your own Raspberry Pi-Arduino laboratory using websockets.
To use this files you have to following previously the instructions into Wiki (https://github.com/go-lab/smart-device/wiki/How-to-use-Node.js-and-Socket.io-labratories-with-Raspberry-Pi-and-Arduino).

Laboratories
============
You can use the files into "robotic_arm-raspberry-pi" folder reading the README files to understand how can you use each folder. Please, read them carefully before download this repository to your Raspberry Pi or PC.
The other laboratories are in Beta version and are not available for now.

Requirements
============
To use this laboratory you have to count with:<br>
-A knowledge of server and client side on linux systems (Raspbian), managing of packages repositories and development experience.<br>
-A Robotic Arm connected to Arduino. <br>
-A Raspberry Pi Model B (is not tested the recently Model B+, yet).<br>
-An Arduino UNO R3 board.<br>
-A PC with Apache server intalled to use on client side.<br>
