=======
As you know the Arduino IDE compiles a folder with the same name of the source code file.
You need to download both (the folder content the *.*ino file) to let the Arduino IDE can upload the code into Arduino UNO R3 board.
This folder content both of them.

Description of the file
=======================
The robotic_arm.ino is a source ode file that let control de Robotic Arm using Arduino UNO R3 board.
The code lines use several algorithms that translate the orders received from Raspberry Pi into movings or actions on the different services of the Robotic Arm.
The results are that, according to options on the client side, the user can move forward/backward, close/open, or turnon/off the respective service.

Language
